# Virtual Presence Robot
## Introducation

This is our summer 2024 work term project in NSCC IT campus, which is a Raspberry Pi-based robot project. Users can remotely control the robot's behavior through a Web interface. These behaviors include real-time camera monitoring and six different movement modes, similar to lunar exploration robots. It contains:

- UV4L-Server
- API-Server
- Motor-Control-Part

## Usage 
_@Our Groupmembers_

Simply put, create repositories for the parts you're responsible for, and then push them up.
- Local git commit
- Create remote repository in Github here
- Add remote in your IDE, remote name origin and push

**Some command you may need:**
```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git config --global --list
```
